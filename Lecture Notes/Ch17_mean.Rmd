# This R script contains two main topics:{-}

# Simulation of mean with graphs

```{r}

mu <- 10 # Population mean
sigma <- 5 # Population s.d.
n <- 30 # Sample size


# Generate a sample
sample <-  rnorm(n,mu,sigma)

# Looking at the sample (optional)
sample 

# Find the of the sample (xbar for the sample)
mean(sample)

# How does the samaple looks like?
hist(sample)


# Now repeat the above process 1000 times and find the average of means

xbar <- numeric(1000)

for (i in 1:1000){
  
  sample <- rnorm(n,mu,sigma)
  xbar[i] <- mean(sample) 
}

# How does the samaple MEAN looks like?
mean(xbar)
sd(xbar)
hist(xbar)

# End of simulation
```

# Using the theoretical distribution to solve problems

```{r}

mu <- 6.1 # Population mean of interest
sigma <- 0.08 # Population sd of interest
n <- 20 # Sample size 


# Mean and the sd of the sampling distribution for xbar
meanxbar <- mu
sdxbar <- sigma/sqrt(n)

meanxbar
sdxbar

```

## Answring probability problems

```{r}

#less than for a normal
#pnorm(value,mean,sd)

pnorm(6,meanxbar,sdxbar)

#greater than for a normal
#1-pnorm(value,mean,sd)

1-pnorm(6,meanxbar,sdxbar)

#between for a normal
#pnorm(bigvalue,mean,sd)-pnorm(smallerval,mean,sd)

pnorm(58,meanxbar,sdxbar)-pnorm(58,meanxbar,sdxbar)

# Given the probability find the quantile
#qnorm(percentless,mean,sd)

qnorm(.9,meanxbar,sdxbar)

```
